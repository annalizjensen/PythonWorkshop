# For Loop Hands-On Activities:

Make and save a new Python file called vowels.py.

### Replace vowels

Write a program that will take two inputs -- a string and a single character and replace every vowel in the input string with the single character. For example, "anna" and "!" would become "!nn!"

For the purpose of these exercises, "y" is a vowel.

Hint: We can use the functions `.lower()` or `upper()` to make a string's case consistent. So `"Anna".lower()` would result in `"anna"`.

### Random vowels

Change your program so that it only takes one input, a string, and replaces the vowels in the string with other random vowels that are not the same original vowel. If the string contains no vowels, print out the original string and tell the user that the string contains no vowels.

For example `"anna"` might become `"enni"`

### Case sensitive replacement
Change your program so that it replaces a vowel with a random vowel in the same case.

For example, `"Anna"` becomes `"Ennu"`
