# Vocabulary

Terms you will need to know when learning Python

### Expression
A collection of variables, values, and function calls that can be Evaluated to a single _value_.
#### examples
```python
1 + 5
"hello" + ", world!"
len("cheese") + x
```

### Evaluation
  The process of reducing an _expression_ of _values_ and _functions_ to a single _value_.
#### example:
```python
(3 + 48) / 6
3 + 8
11
```

### Execution
Similar to _evaluation_. Running a program, one _statement_ after another.

### Statement
A single instruction given to the computer, for example, an _assignment_ statement, or an if statement.

### Variable
A named container (or "box") that can hold a _value_.
#### examples:
```python
x
y
name
last_name
```

### Value
An individual piece of data - either a _literal_, a _variable_, or a _function_ result.
#### examples:
```python
3
"hello"
len("hello")
first_name
```

### Literal
The actual number 1 or string "hello" - as compared to a _variable_ or _expression_ that _evaluates_ to a _value_.
#### examples:
```python
"hello"
1
-45.29
```

### Type, or Data Type
A category of _values_, often arranged in a hierarchy (think animal classification). Numbers, Interger Numbers, Characters, Strings (collection of characters)
#### examples:
```python
int
str
```

### function
A list of _statements_ and _expressions_ for transforming a set of input _values_ to an output _value_
#### examples of calling functions:
```python
sum(1, 2, 3)     # -> 6
str(x)           # -> string representation of x
len("hello")     # -> 5
```

### Operator
A _function_ that "operates" on one or more _values_.
#### examples of using operators:
```python
"hello" + ", world"
10 / 4
11 // 3
9 - 1
4 * -1
```

### Resolve
The process of looking up a _value_ named by a _variable_.

### Assignment
The process of putting a _value_ into a named _variable_ ("box"). Confusingly written "=", as in `x = x + 1`.
#### examples:
```python
x = x + 1
y = m * x + b
salutation = "Ms. " + first_name + " " + last_name
count = 23
```

### Comment
Non-functioning text in your program, after the '#'

#### example:
```python
x = x + 10.0    # move 10 pixels to the right
```
